[CPP's crawl viz](https://web-archive-group.github.io/WALK-CrawlVis/crawl-sites/TORONTO_Canadian_Political_Parties-urls.html) is very interesting.

    "# Enter Data into a NoSql Database\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSql is all the rage these days. Not that that really means that much. Sql or *structured query language* was the standard for everything not very long ago. The reason for this is that computer processing had a hard time processing lots of data, so we spent a lot of time trying to keep everything organized so it was easy to get at later. NoSQL does not use SQL. That sounds fancy, but one of the most common ways to store data is to apply \"key-value pairs\" which, if you know anything about programming, is the exact same thing that a Dictionary in Python or an Object in Javascript does.  It's also the way that JSON, a popular alternative to XML, works.  For instance:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "{\"key\" : \"value\" }\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "There!  I just did nosql.  So exciting eh?  Well, there's more to it than this of course. One advantage to this approach is its flexibility.  Instead of conforming to a specific schema or structure, you can just put the data in a store and make things up as you go along. The code below does this."
